Singularity images can be easily built from Docker images, so we'll just use
our Docker images unaltered.

You will need to have Singularity installed. Run the installSingularity.sh
script with CWD at the same directory in which the script resides:

$ ./installSingularity.sh

or alternatively, follow the installation procedures described here:

https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps

After that, just run the runIlastikInSingularity.sh script to get a shell into
the ilastik container. Singularity will automatically bind-mount your $HOME
directory into your container so you can access you .ilp projects as well as
your sample data files from within the host's HOME dir.

If you've installed Singularity via the installSingularity.sh script, than
you can uninstall it via the uninstallSingularity.sh script
